Element Capture
===============

This is a Chrome extension which will screen capture any HTML element of your choosing.

Click the camera icon in the URL bar to begin selection, then hover over any element and click to capture an image and open it in a new tab.

The icon is from http://findicons.com/icon/90219/camera?id=330056
